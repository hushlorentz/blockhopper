I hope there is enough usable footage here! Some things are just meant for a quick montage. Most things will have to be edited just because there's a long pause when I switch from iphone to mouse controls. :\ If this is total garbage, I can show you how to record using iSimulate and Snapz Pro!

For the flow of the trailer, I was thinking.

0:00 - 0:05 Green Pixel Splash
0:05 - 0:10 Starship Amazing Splash
0:10 - 0:20 Running and jumping on stuff.
0:20 - 0:30 Placing blocks
0:30 - 0:40 Editor
0:40 - 0:45 Loading user level
0:45 - 0:55 Montage
0:55 - 1:00 Some final screen like the main menu with the Available on iTunes image. 

If these times seem ridiculous, it's because I just made them up! :D It's all just a starting point.



Place_Blocks.mov: just shows placement and running across. Much too long to be used in full. 

Platforms.mov: The first 5 seconds shows placing an up/down platform and riding it a bit. Then the screen flips because someone sent me a text haha. We don't need it all anyway. At 0:30, there is a bit that shows placing a left/right platform.

Splash.mov: is the splash screens as I didn't know how to display a picture and fade it for the trailer. :D The GreenPixel part flips which is an unavoidable side-effect of the simulator. :\ But maybe there's a way to just show the two images and fade with iMovie.
