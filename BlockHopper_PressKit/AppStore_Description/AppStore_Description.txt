BlockHopper - App Store Description

Help the spunky and optimistic robot, Bit, avoid certain doom by placing Blocks in this exciting 2D puzzle/platformer! Place them wisely as you run, hop, and think your way to the Goal!

Inspired by the great platformers of yesteryear, Bit will have to use moving platforms, conveyor belts, springboards, disappearing blocks, and switches that activate different kinds of gates. 

Travel with Bit through 35 levels spread over 6 different themes. Each theme features a different song by the excellent Starship Amazing! 

Do you find our levels too easy and know you can do better? Go for it! We've included a full-featured level editor so you can upload and share your own levels. Sorting options and filters make it easy to play levels created by your favorite user!
